# Purpose
This group project focused on creating and executing a web application with team members to solve a real-world problem. Our application allows users to create a smoothie based on a set list of ingredients and see the nutritional output based on all of the ingredients they have chosen. We have used server-side APIs to retireve the nutritional information. Users can also save their favorite smoothie from our set list of smoothies on our "favorites page".
